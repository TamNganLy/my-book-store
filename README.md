## 📚 My Book Store  

A personal web app to store the books I’ve read — along with my notes and ratings.  
*(Currently using mostly dummy data, since this project is for learning purposes!)*  

---

### 🧠 Purpose  
This project is part of my journey to practice building a **full-stack web application** using **PostgreSQL**, **Node.js (Express)**, **EJS**, and **CSS**.  

---

### 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** EJS, CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (local), will later deploy on **Render**  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

---

### 📖 Features  
- View a list of all books  
- Add new books (title, author, note, rating)  
- Edit or delete existing books  
- Fetch book covers from [Open Library Cover API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers) or upload custom cover images  
- Filter books by genre or rating  
- Search books by title
- Store and fetch data from PostgreSQL  

---

### 🌐 Deployment (Planned)
Once complete, the project will be hosted on **Render** with a live PostgreSQL database.

---

### 🧩 Future Improvements  
- Add user login system  
- Improve UI with more modern design  

---

### 📬 Notes  
This is a **learning project**, so most of the data (books, notes, ratings) are **dummy data** for demonstration only.
